## Synopsis

Talon is a Python application that will allow a user to perform a more thorough forensic analysis of a Twitter profile by analyzing the content, location, media, and chronological activity of a given username. This tool was developed as a free and open source alternative to tools such as X1 Social Media Discovery and Twitter Investigator.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/jfk2670/Talon-475_2141-Eddy-Kelleher-Salsone.git

## Usage

python talon.py -­u <username> [-c <count>]

## Motivation

We decided upon this tool for a few reasons. Primarily, we wanted to develop a unique tool that that performed a useful function. Many projects focus on memory/file analysis, recovery, and acquisition. By analyzing Twitter timelines, we accomplish a few different goals, as well. Interacting with the Twitter API gains us valuable programming knowledge, as none of our team members have had much experience using a public API. By doing this, we can become more well­rounded programmers in many ways. 
 
We decided to develop this tool in Python because all members were familiar with this language. With experience in a few different areas of Python development, we decided to use our different strengths to develop a comprehensive and robust tool.
